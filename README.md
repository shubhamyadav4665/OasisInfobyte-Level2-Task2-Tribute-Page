# OasisInfobyte-Level2-Task2-Tribute-Page
ðŸŒŸ This is my Level 2 - Task 2 submission for the Web Development and Designing Internship at Oasis Infobyte. A Tribute Page created using HTML and CSS, dedicated to someone I admire. The project showcases clean design, responsive layout, styled typography, and a well-organized structureâ€”perfect for beginners learning web fundamentals.
